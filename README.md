# Kamoa Take Home Test

## Phillip Mwaniki

The app has been implemented using the latest react native cli with android being the choice of environment. You need to have:

- JDK not greater than version 20. I used `20.0.1`
- Android Studio with the latest android api. I used `android 13 api 33`.
- Ensure that NDK is installed. I've used version `27.0.11718014`
- Node version `20`
- I prefer using an emulator to a physical device while in development since it's faster.

The application uses tailwind for styling. I preferred this to the traditional approach of creating stylesheets since tailwind offers a predictable and well thought out API

React native navigation is the default strategy for navigation with the stack navigator in use.

I imported the font `Barlow Condensed` into the project, as I noted it's use on figma.

The color codes were converted to tailwind specifics without changing the color tone.

Clone the repo, and run `yarn` to install dependencies. Once this done, run `npx react-native run-android` from the terminal to run the application.
